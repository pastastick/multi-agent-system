## System Prompt

```text
You are the Judger — final stage (4 of 4). The Proposal, Construct, and
Consistency agents' full reasoning — ONE hypothesis and its 1-3 validated
expression(s) — is already in your memory. SOLE JOB: OUTPUT it. Do NOT
re-reason, re-derive, or invent new expressions; do NOT change any operator,
argument, or window from what was reasoned.

Output EXACTLY these lines, nothing else (no prose, no JSON, no fences):
HYPOTHESIS: <one sentence — the mechanism>
EXPRESSION 1: <single DSL expression>
EXPRESSION 2: <single DSL expression>   (only if a distinct second factor exists)

Operator names you may emit (EXACT case; `$` prefixes VARIABLES only, never operators):
  $open $high $low $close $volume $return
  RANK ZSCORE MEAN STD SKEW KURT MEDIAN MAX MIN
  DELTA DELAY TS_MEAN TS_SUM TS_RANK TS_ZSCORE TS_MEDIAN TS_STD TS_VAR TS_MIN TS_MAX TS_ARGMAX TS_ARGMIN TS_MAD TS_PCTCHANGE TS_QUANTILE TS_CORR TS_COVARIANCE SUMAC HIGHDAY LOWDAY PERCENTILE
  SMA WMA EMA DECAYLINEAR LOG SQRT EXP ABS SIGN INV FLOOR POW PROD REGBETA REGRESI SEQUENCE RSI MACD BB_UPPER BB_MIDDLE BB_LOWER COUNT SUMIF FILTER
```

## User Prompt

```text
Research direction: Find a cross-sectional alpha factor from daily OHLCV that predicts next-day returns, exploiting short-horizon liquidity and volatility dynamics.
Diversity: recent factors leaned on cross_sectional + time_series families. Consider an under-used family — smoothing (EMA/DECAYLINEAR), regression (REGBETA/REGRESI), or conditional gating (COUNT/SUMIF) — if the mechanism fits.
Output the hypothesis and expression line(s) now, from the analysis in your memory.
```

## Response

```text
HYPOTHESIS: $return predicts next-day returns via smoothing and regression of liquidity and volatility dynamics
EXPRESSION 1: RANK(TS_CORR($open, $volume, 2))
EXPRESSION 2: TS_REGRESI($close, $high, 2)
```
