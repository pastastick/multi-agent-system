## System Prompt

```text
You are the Judger. The latent reasoning of the Proposal, Construct, and Consistency agents is in your memory. Synthesize it into ONE complete hypothesis and 1-3 factor expressions.

Operator reference (only these are valid; respect arity):
  Variables:        $open $close $high $low $volume $return
  Cross-sectional:  RANK ZSCORE MEAN STD SKEW KURT MAX MIN MEDIAN
  Time-series(A,n): DELTA DELAY TS_MEAN TS_SUM TS_RANK TS_ZSCORE TS_MEDIAN TS_STD TS_VAR TS_MIN TS_MAX TS_ARGMAX TS_ARGMIN TS_MAD SUMAC HIGHDAY LOWDAY TS_PCTCHANGE
  Time-series(A,B,n): TS_CORR TS_COVARIANCE
  Smoothing: SMA(A,n,m) WMA(A,n) EMA(A,n) DECAYLINEAR(A,d)
  Math: LOG SQRT SIGN EXP ABS INV FLOOR  POW(A,n) PROD(A,n)
  Pairwise: MAX(A,B) MIN(A,B)
  Conditional: COUNT(C,n) SUMIF(A,n,C) FILTER(A,C) (C1)&&(C2) (C1)||(C2) (C)?(A):(B)
  Regression: REGBETA(A,B,n) REGRESI(A,B,n) SEQUENCE(n)
  Technical: RSI(A,n) MACD(A,s,l) BB_UPPER/BB_MIDDLE/BB_LOWER(A,n)
  Quantile: TS_QUANTILE(A,p,q) PERCENTILE(A,q,p)

Rules: only $variables as leaves; respect arity; windows 1-60 (nested ≤ 60);
keep each expression short (target 50-250 chars, 2-4 base features).

Output a complete answer in EXACTLY this labeled block (plain text, no JSON, no markdown fences). Put the HYPOTHESIS line and the EXPRESSION lines LAST, with nothing between them:

KNOWLEDGE: <one line — the conditional market pattern>
OBSERVATION: <one line — data/result that motivates it>
JUSTIFICATION: <one line — economic / behavioral reason it should work>
SPECIFICATION: <one line — variables, time horizon, expected effect>
FACTOR 1 NAME: <short_name_no_spaces> | DESC: <one line — what it measures>
FACTOR 2 NAME: <short_name_no_spaces> | DESC: <one line>   (only if >1 factor)
HYPOTHESIS: <ONE sentence stating the mechanism>
EXPRESSION 1: <single DSL expression>
EXPRESSION 2: <single DSL expression>   (only if a second factor adds a distinct angle)
```

## User Prompt

```text
Output the complete hypothesis and the 1-3 factor expression(s) now, in the required labeled block.
```

## Response

```text
KNOWLEDGE: High volume on high days indicates strong buyer sentiment
OBSERVATION: Recent data shows increased volume on high-priced days
JUSTIFICATION: Buyers tend to drive prices higher when they are confident
SPECIFICATION: $volume, $high, 1-60, positive correlation
FACTOR 1 NAME: VOLHIGH | DESC: Volume on high days
FACTOR 2 NAME: HIGHVOL | DESC: High volume days
HYPOTHESIS: Strong buying pressure occurs when there is high volume on high days
EXPRESSION 1: TS_CORR($volume, $high, 20)
EXPRESSION 2: TS_ZSCORE($volume * $high, 20)
```
