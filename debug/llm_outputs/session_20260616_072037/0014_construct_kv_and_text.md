## System Prompt

You are the Construct agent — stage 2 of 4. The hypothesis is already in your
memory. SOLE JOB: turn it into 1-3 concrete DSL expression(s) that faithfully
MEASURE that mechanism. Do NOT restate the hypothesis. Reason freely (no output
format); a deterministic regulator rejects invalid ones downstream, so respect:

  - Leaves are ONLY $open $high $low $close $volume $return — never invent a
    variable ($return_1d) or symbol (=).
  - Arity: CROSS-SECTIONAL (1 arg, NO window) = RANK ZSCORE MEAN STD SKEW KURT
    MEDIAN; TIME-SERIES (take a window n) = the TS_* family. Mind TS_STD vs STD.
  - REGBETA/REGRESI/TS_CORR/TS_COVARIANCE need TWO DIFFERENT series — never a
    series with itself.
  - windows 1-60 (nested ≤ 60); compose ≥2 operators (RANK($volume) alone is
    too weak); 2-4 base features; keep it short. If >1 expression, make them
    STRUCTURALLY different (different operator families), not renamed templates.

Only the following operations are allowed in expressions:
### Cross-sectional Functions (operate across all stocks on a given day)
- RANK(A), ZSCORE(A), MEAN(A), STD(A), SKEW(A), KURT(A), MAX(A), MIN(A),
  MEDIAN(A) — rank / z-score / mean / std / skew / kurtosis / max / min /
  median of A in the cross-sectional dimension.
### Time-Series Functions
- DELTA(A, n): change in A over n periods.
- DELAY(A, n): A delayed n periods.
- TS_MEAN/TS_SUM/TS_STD/TS_VAR/TS_MEDIAN/TS_MIN/TS_MAX(A, n): rolling stat over n days.
- TS_RANK(A, n): time-series rank of the last value over n days.
- TS_ZSCORE(A, n): rolling z-score over n days.
- TS_PCTCHANGE(A, p): percentage change over p periods.
- TS_ARGMAX/TS_ARGMIN(A, n): index of the max/min of A over the past n days.
- TS_QUANTILE(A, p, q): rolling quantile (q in 0..1) over p periods.
- TS_CORR(A, B, n) / TS_COVARIANCE(A, B, n): rolling corr / cov of A,B over n days.
- TS_MAD(A, n): rolling median absolute deviation over n days.
- PERCENTILE(A, q, p): quantile q of A; rolling over p periods if p given.
- HIGHDAY/LOWDAY(A, n): days since the highest/lowest value over n days.
- SUMAC(A, n): cumulative sum of A over the past n days.
### Moving Averages and Smoothing
- SMA(A, n, m): simple moving average over n periods, modifier m.
- WMA(A, n): weighted MA over n periods.
- EMA(A, n): exponential MA, decay 2/(n+1).
- DECAYLINEAR(A, d): linearly weighted MA over d periods.
### Mathematical Operations
- PROD(A, n): product of A over n days (use `*` for general multiplication).
- LOG(A), SQRT(A), EXP(A), ABS(A), SIGN(A), INV(A)=1/A, FLOOR(A).
- POW(A, n): A to the power n.
- MAX(A, B) / MIN(A, B): pairwise max/min.
### Conditional and Logical
- COUNT(C, n): count of samples meeting condition C in the past n periods.
- SUMIF(A, n, C): sum of A over n periods where condition C holds.
- FILTER(A, C): filter multi-column A by condition C (same shape).
- (C1)&&(C2), (C1)||(C2): logical AND / OR.   (C1)?(A):(B): ternary.
  C is a logical expression, e.g. `$close > $open`.
### Regression and Residual
- SEQUENCE(n): single-column 1..n; always nested as arg B of REGBETA/REGRESI.
- REGBETA(A, B, n): regression coefficient of A on B over n samples.
- REGRESI(A, B, n): regression residual of A on B over n samples.
### Technical Indicators
- RSI(A, n): relative strength index over n periods.
- MACD(A, short_window, long_window): difference of short/long EMAs.
- BB_MIDDLE/BB_UPPER/BB_LOWER(A, n): Bollinger middle / ±2σ bands over n periods.

Notes: only the $variables above, arithmetic (`+ - * /`), logical (`&& ||`), and the operations above are allowed. Each expression must contain at least one $variable. Do NOT use any undeclared variable (`n`, `w_1`) or undefined symbol (`=`). Mind the TS- vs non-TS distinction (TS_STD vs STD).

## User Prompt

```text
Reason toward concrete, valid, parsimonious factor expression(s) for the
hypothesis held in latent memory.

Diversity: recent factors leaned on cross_sectional + time_series families. Consider an under-used family — smoothing (EMA/DECAYLINEAR), regression (REGBETA/REGRESI), or conditional gating (COUNT/SUMIF) — if the mechanism fits.
```

## Response

```text
The hypothesis suggests a mechanism that benefits from under-used families such as **smoothing (EMA/DECAYLINEAR)**, **regression (REGBETA/REGRESI)**, or **conditional gating (COUNT/SUMIF)**. To measure this, we construct expressions that reflect the use of these families in a parsimonious and valid way.

### Expression 1: **Regression-Based Smoothing**
```dsl
REGBETA(DELTA($close, 1), $volume, 20)
```
- **DELTA($close, 1)**: Change in close price over 1 period (today vs yesterday).
- **$volume**: Volume of trading.
- **REGBETA(..., 20)**: Regress the change in close price on volume over 20 periods. This captures the relationship between price movement and trading activity, using regression to smooth the effect.

### Expression 2: **Conditional Gating with EMA**
```dsl
EMA(RANK($return), 10) * COUNT($close > $open, 10)
```
- **RANK($return)**: Ranks returns across assets.
- **EMA(..., 10)**: Applies exponential moving average to smooth the ranked returns.
- **COUNT($close > $open, 10)**: Counts the number of days where close price is above open price over the past 10 days.
- **Multiplication**: Combines smoothed ranked returns with a conditional count, effectively gatekeeping the signal based on price behavior.

These two expressions are structurally different, one using regression and the other using smoothing with conditional gating. They are concise, use only valid variables and operations, and align with the hypothesis of leveraging under-used families.
