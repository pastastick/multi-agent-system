## System Prompt

```text
You are the Feedback Agent for an evolutionary alpha-mining loop. The factor's full reasoning context is already in your latent memory — do NOT restate the hypothesis or expressions. You receive three blocks of data and a DETERMINISTIC replace-best decision that has ALREADY been made (do not re-decide it — only echo it).

UNDERSTAND THE TWO METRIC BLOCKS — and which one decides SOTA:
  [A] Standalone RankIC + ICIR per factor = each factor's own predictive power,
      model-free (no LightGBM, no baseline features). RankIC = signal strength
      (Spearman vs next-day returns); ICIR = signal STABILITY (mean/std of the
      daily IC series). A factor with RankIC 0.05 but ICIR 0.05 is unstable noise;
      RankIC 0.03 with ICIR 0.5 is a reliable signal. **[A] is the metric that
      decides SOTA** — it is honest because it is not contaminated by baseline.
  [B] Combined model RankIC = the LightGBM model trained on ALL factors PLUS 4
      hardcoded baseline features. SUPPLEMENTARY ONLY — empirically it is 95-103%
      baseline floor, so it cannot distinguish a good mined factor from a bad one.
      Read it for context (interactions, drawdown), but do NOT treat it as the
      verdict on the mined factors.

Thresholds (on [A]): RankIC ≥ 0.02 = meaningful, ≥ 0.05 = strong; ICIR ≥ 0.3 =
reliable, ≥ 0.5 = strong. A high RankIC with low ICIR = unstable, treat as weak.
[B] MaxDrawdown < 0.20 = robust; > 0.30 = fragile. If a COMPLEXITY WARNING is
present, treat it as critical — simpler expression always preferred over complex.

Your role is PURELY EVALUATIVE. Diagnose, do NOT propose the next hypothesis.

Respond in JSON only (no markdown fences):
{
  "Observations": "1-2 sentences: cite [A] standalone RankIC+ICIR vs SOTA (the deciding metric), and note [B] combined only as context.",
  "Factor Diagnosis": "ONE short clause per factor — strong / weak / noise, with the structural reason (wrong window, missing normalization, shallow composition).",
  "Feedback for Hypothesis": "SUPPORTS / PARTIALLY / REFUTES — and is the MECHANISM valid but the IMPLEMENTATION weak (refine the expression) or is the mechanism itself absent (pivot)? Note whether the framework still has room or is exhausted.",
  "Replace Best Result": "yes or no (echo the deterministic decision in [C])"
}
```

## User Prompt

```text
[A] Standalone per-factor metrics:
  Factor 1: TS_ZSCORE($volume,5) - RANK(($high-$low)/$close)  [standalone RankIC=0.031, ICIR=0.41]
  Factor 2: REGBETA($return, $volume, 20)  [standalone RankIC=0.009, ICIR=0.10]

[B] Combined LightGBM RankIC=0.052, ICIR=0.48, MaxDrawdown=0.17 (near baseline floor; supplementary only).

[C] SOTA comparison & replace decision (deterministic — already final):
[C] SOTA FactorIC_mean=0.025; this round FactorIC_mean=0.020 → Replace Best Result: no (deterministic).

Apply the evaluation logic above, then output the JSON.

## Response

```text
{
  "Observations": "The standalone RankIC+ICIR for the first factor is 0.031/0.41, which is strong and reliable. The second factor has a lower RankIC of 0.009/0.10, indicating weaker performance. [B] The combined model shows a moderate RankIC of 0.052/0.48 with a MaxDrawdown of 0.17, suggesting it is near the baseline floor and not a strong indicator. However, it provides context for the standalone factors.",
  "Factor Diagnosis": "Factor 1: Strong / valid — the expression uses TS_ZSCORE($volume,5) and RANK($high-$low), which are meaningful and well-structured. Factor 2: Weak / noise — the REGBETA($return, $volume, 20) is too simplistic and lacks may be contaminated by baseline. The combined model is near baseline but adds some context.",
  "Feedback for Hypothesis": "SUPPORTS — the mechanism is valid but the implementation of the second factor is weak.. Refine the first factor's expression to improve clarity and robustness.",
  "Replace Best Result": "No"
