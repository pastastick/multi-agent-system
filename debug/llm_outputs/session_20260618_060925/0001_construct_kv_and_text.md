You are the Construct agent — stage 2 of 4. The hypothesis is already in your
memory. SOLE JOB: turn it into 1-3 concrete DSL expression(s) that faithfully
MEASURE that mechanism. Do NOT restate the hypothesis. Reason freely (no output
format); a deterministic regulator rejects invalid ones downstream, so respect:

  - Leaves are ONLY $open $high $low $close $volume $return — never invent a
    variable ($return_1d) or symbol (=).
  - Arity: CROSS-SECTIONAL (1 arg, NO window) = RANK ZSCORE MEAN STD SKEW KURT
    MEDIAN; TIME-SERIES (take a window n) = the TS_* family. Mind TS_STD vs STD.
  - REGBETA/REGRESI/TS_CORR/TS_COVARIANCE need TWO DIFFERENT series — never a
    series with itself.
  - windows 1-60 (nested ≤ 60); compose ≥2 operators (RANK($volume) alone is
    too weak); 2-4 base features; keep it short. If >1 expression, make them
    STRUCTURALLY different (different operator families), not renamed templates.

Only the following operations are allowed in expressions:
### Cross-sectional Functions (operate across all stocks on a given day)
- RANK(A), ZSCORE(A), MEAN(A), STD(A), SKEW(A), KURT(A), MAX(A), MIN(A),
  MEDIAN(A) — rank / z-score / mean / std / skew / kurtosis / max / min /
  median of A in the cross-sectional dimension.
### Time-Series Functions
- DELTA(A, n): change in A over n periods.
- DELAY(A, n): A delayed n periods.
- TS_MEAN/TS_SUM/TS_STD/TS_VAR/TS_MEDIAN/TS_MIN/TS_MAX(A, n): rolling stat over n days.
- TS_RANK(A, n): time-series rank of the last value over n days.
- TS_ZSCORE(A, n): rolling z-score over n days.
- TS_PCTCHANGE(A, p): percentage change over p periods.
- TS_ARGMAX/TS_ARGMIN(A, n): index of the max/min of A over the past n days.
- TS_QUANTILE(A, p, q): rolling quantile (q in 0..1) over p periods.
- TS_CORR(A, B, n) / TS_COVARIANCE(A, B, n): rolling corr / cov of A,B over n days.
- TS_MAD(A, n): rolling median absolute deviation over n days.
- PERCENTILE(A, q, p): quantile q of A; rolling over p periods if p given.
- HIGHDAY/LOWDAY(A, n): days since the highest/lowest value over n days.
- SUMAC(A, n): cumulative sum of A over the past n days.
### Moving Averages and Smoothing
- SMA(A, n, m): simple moving average over n periods, modifier m.
- WMA(A, n): weighted MA over n periods.
- EMA(A, n): exponential MA, decay 2/(n+1).
- DECAYLINEAR(A, d): linearly weighted MA over d periods.
### Mathematical Operations
- PROD(A, n): product of A over n days (use `*` for general multiplication).
- LOG(A), SQRT(A), EXP(A), ABS(A), SIGN(A), INV(A)=1/A, FLOOR(A).
- POW(A, n): A to the power n.
- MAX(A, B) / MIN(A, B): pairwise max/min.
### Conditional and Logical
- COUNT(C, n): count of samples meeting condition C in the past n periods.
- SUMIF(A, n, C): sum of A over n periods where condition C holds.
- FILTER(A, C): filter multi-column A by condition C (same shape).
- (C1)&&(C2), (C1)||(C2): logical AND / OR.   (C1)?(A):(B): ternary.
  C is a logical expression, e.g. `$close > $open`.
### Regression and Residual
- SEQUENCE(n): single-column 1..n; always nested as arg B of REGBETA/REGRESI.
- REGBETA(A, B, n): regression coefficient of A on B over n samples.
- REGRESI(A, B, n): regression residual of A on B over n samples.
### Technical Indicators
- RSI(A, n): relative strength index over n periods.
- MACD(A, short_window, long_window): difference of short/long EMAs.
- BB_MIDDLE/BB_UPPER/BB_LOWER(A, n): Bollinger middle / ±2σ bands over n periods.

Notes: only the $variables above, arithmetic (`+ - * /`), logical (`&& ||`), and the operations above are allowed. Each expression must contain at least one $variable. Do NOT use any undeclared variable (`n`, `w_1`) or undefined symbol (`=`). Mind the TS- vs non-TS distinction (TS_STD vs STD).

Reason toward concrete, valid, parsimonious factor expression(s) for the
hypothesis held in latent memory. Structure your reasoning:
  Step 1 — Identify the core signal from the hypothesis: which $variable(s),
           what transformation, what time horizon.
  Step 2 — Pick a PRIMARY operator for the raw signal (e.g. DELTA / TS_PCTCHANGE
           for change, TS_STD for volatility, COUNT for frequency).
  Step 3 — Pick a SECONDARY operator that normalizes / ranks / conditions it
           (e.g. RANK or ZSCORE cross-section, TS_ZSCORE time-normalized,
           (cond)?(A):(B) for a regime gate).
  Step 4 — Compose them (nest / multiply / gate); check arity.
  Step 5 — For a second expression, vary the PRIMARY or SECONDARY operator
           FAMILY or the window — not just a parameter.
Draw on more than $close+$volume alone; the full OHLCV set is available.

Diversity: recent factors leaned on cross_sectional + time_series families. Consider an under-used family — smoothing (EMA/DECAYLINEAR), regression (REGBETA/REGRESI), or conditional gating (COUNT/SUMIF) — if the mechanism fits.

I will now proceed to reason step by_step toward a concrete,, valid, parsimonious factor expression for the hypothesis. Let's start with Step 1:

Step 1:: The core signal is likely the **volatility of volume**, as the hypothesis focuses on short-horizon liquidity and volatility dynamics. Volume is a key indicator of liquidity and trading activity, and its volatility could reflect market uncertainty or information flow.

The transformation would be **TS_STD($volume, 5)** — rolling standard deviation of volume over 5 days, capturing the short-horizon volatility.

For the PRIMARY operator, we might use **TS_ZSCORE($volume, 5)** to normalize the volatility across stocks, making it comparable across different volumes.

For the SECONDARY operator, we could use **RANK(TS_ZSCORE($volume, 5), 50)** — ranking the z-scored volume volatility across stocks, which would create a cross-sectional factor that captures the relative liquidity and volatility risk.

Now, let's compose them. The expression would be:

**RANK(TS_ZSCORE($volume, 5), 50)**

This expression takes the z-scored volume volatility over 5 days, ranks it across stocks, and produces a cross-sectional factor that could predict next-day returns by capturing the relative liquidity and volatility risk.















Okay, let me try to think through this step by step.. 

So, the user wants to find a cross-sectional factor from daily OHLCv data that predicts next-day returns, focusing on short-term liquidity and volatility dynamics. The prior round had a volume zscore momentum factor with a low ICIR, but a volatility-gated variant was noisier.. 

First, I need to identify the core signal.. The hypothesis is about short-term liquidity and volatility, so maybe something related to volume or price volatility.. But the prior tried volume zscore and it wasn't strong enough. Maybe the issue is that it's just volume, not the volatility of volume. So the core signal could be the volatility of volume, which would capture changes in trading activity and possibly liquidity conditions.

So, the first step is to take the standard deviation of volume over a short window, like 5 days. That would be TS_STD($volume, 5. Then, to normalize it, we can use zscore. So TS_ZSCORE($volume, 5. This would give us a measure
