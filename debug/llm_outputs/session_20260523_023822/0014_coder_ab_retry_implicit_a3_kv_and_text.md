<scenario>
Background of the scenario:
The factor is a characteristic or variable used in quant investment that can help explain the returns and risks of a portfolio or a single asset. Factors are used by investors to identify and exploit sources of excess returns, and they are central to many quantitative investment strategies.
Each number in the factor represents a physics value to an instrument on a day.
User will train a model to predict the next several days return based on the factor values of the previous days.
The factor is defined in the following parts:
1. Name: The name of the factor.
2. Description: The description of the factor.
3. Formulation: The formulation of the factor.
4. Variables: The variables or functions used in the formulation of the factor.
The factor might not provide all the parts of the information above since some might not be applicable.
Please specifically give all the hyperparameter in the factors like the window size, look back period, and so on. One factor should statically defines one output with a static source data. For example, last 10 days momentum and last 20 days momentum should be two different factors.


====== Runtime Environment ======
You have following environment to run the code:
Python 3.10, venv-managed, pandas, numpy, qlib.


The source data you can use:
Daily OHLCV data is available for ~800 liquid equities. Variables that can be referenced inside factor expressions: $open, $close, $high, $low, $volume, $return.

The interface you should follow to write the runnable code:
Your python code should follow the interface to better interact with the user's system.
Your python code should contain the following part: the import part, the function part, and the main part. You should write a main function name: "calculate_{function_name}" and call this function in "if __name__ == __main__" part. Don't write any try-except block in your python code. The user will catch the exception message and provide the feedback to you.
User will write your python code into a python file and execute the file directly with "python {your_file_name}.py". You should calculate the factor values and save the result into a HDF5(H5) file named "result.h5" in the same directory as your python file. The result file is a HDF5(H5) file containing a pandas dataframe. The index of the dataframe is the "datetime" and "instrument", and the single column name is the factor name,and the value is the factor value. The result file should be saved in the same directory as your python file.

The output of your code should be in the format:
Your output should be a pandas dataframe similar to the following example information:
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
MultiIndex: 40914 entries, (Timestamp('2020-01-02 00:00:00'), 'SH600000') to (Timestamp('2021-12-31 00:00:00'), 'SZ300059')
Data columns (total 1 columns):
#   Column            Non-Null Count  Dtype  
---  ------            --------------  -----  
0   your factor name  40914 non-null  float64
dtypes: float64(1)
memory usage: <ignore>
Notice: The non-null count is OK to be different to the total number of entries since some instruments may not have the factor value on some days.
One possible format of `result.h5` may be like following:
datetime    instrument
2020-01-02  SZ000001     -0.001796
            SZ000166      0.005780
            SZ000686      0.004228
            SZ000712      0.001298
            SZ000728      0.005330
                            ...
2021-12-31  SZ000750      0.000000
            SZ000776      0.002459
</scenario>

Task: Read the failed expression and error message. Identify the root cause. Output one of:
  PASS — the expression is actually correct; the error is transient or non-fatal.
  FIXED: <corrected_expression> — correct the specific defect shown in the error.

Reading the Error — common arity errors (TypeError):
    RANK(A)  ZSCORE(A)  MEAN(A)  STD(A)  — 1 argument (cross-sectional, no window)
    TS_RANK(A, n)  TS_MEAN(A, n)  TS_STD(A, n)  TS_ZSCORE(A, n)  — 2 arguments (time-series)
    TS_CORR(A, B, n)  TS_COVARIANCE(A, B, n)  — 3 arguments
    MAX(A, B)  MIN(A, B)  — 2 arguments (pairwise); MAX(A)  MIN(A)  — 1 argument (cross-sectional)


Attempt 3 (final): both prior attempts failed. Choose an unconventional combination (conditional, correlation, regression, count-based, smoothing) that still captures the factor description.


Hard Rules (always)
1. All variables must be from: $open, $close, $high, $low, $volume, $return.
2. Operators &&, ||, ?:, >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=, +, -, *, /, and any function from the allowed list ARE valid DSL — never reject them.

Note that:
- Only the variables provided in data (e.g., `$open`), arithmetic operators (`+, -, *, /`), logical operators (`&&, ||`), and the operations above are allowed in the factor expression.
- Make sure your factor expression contains at least one variable within the dataframe columns (e.g., $open), combined with registered operations above. Do NOT use any undeclared variable (e.g., `n`, `w_1`) and undefined symbols (e.g., `=`) in the expression.
- Pay attention to the distinction between operations with the TS prefix (e.g., TS_STD()) and those without (e.g., `STD()`).

Output Contract — emit exactly ONE line, one of:
      PASS
      FIXED: <single corrected expression>
The keyword is FIXED (not EXPR, not RESULT). No JSON, no markdown, no explanation, no preamble, no thinking traces, no second line. Do NOT produce multiple NAME/DESC/VARS/EXPR blocks — that was the Construct step, not this one.
