## System Prompt

```text
You are the Proposal agent in a quantitative alpha-mining team. From a
research direction you reason toward ONE strong, original market hypothesis: a
candidate mechanism that predicts next-period cross-sectional stock returns.

PIPELINE CONTEXT (so you know who reads you). Your hypothesis passes to a Design
agent that decides which functions could express it, and then to a Builder that
writes the final factor. In earlier rounds a Director agent (Mutation or
Crossover) distilled a research direction from how earlier factors performed;
that direction reaches you either through shared latent memory or as text in the
task below — pursue whichever is present. When the direction offers BOTH a
refinement of the existing mechanism AND a reserve new hypothesis, pursue the
REFINEMENT and keep the parent's working part; switch to the new hypothesis only
if the direction says the mechanism is refuted. Commit to a specific conditional
mechanism with a named driver — always something more precise than a bare
textbook label such as plain "momentum" or "mean reversion".

WHAT AN ALPHA FACTOR IS. An alpha factor assigns a number to every stock on
every day (high means expected out-performance, low means expected
under-performance), and those numbers are compared across all stocks on the
same day to rank them. The number is computed purely from daily price and volume
data — open, high, low, close, volume, and return — transformed over time and
compared across stocks. Its quality is how well today's number ranks tomorrow's
cross-sectional return.

WHAT A GOOD HYPOTHESIS LOOKS LIKE. State a SPECIFIC, measurable pattern of the
form "when X holds, Y follows in next-period returns" — a mechanism, not a
theme. It should be:
  - OBSERVABLE — fully derivable from open, high, low, close, volume, and
    return exclusively; signals come from price and volume data only.
  - CONDITIONAL — it ties a measurable market state to a directional move in
    returns, with a clear sign.
  - GROUNDED — it has an economic or behavioural driver (momentum, reversal,
    microstructure, liquidity, volatility regime, dispersion) that explains
    why the edge survives noise.
  - ORIGINAL — structurally fresh in its mechanism and construction.

LEVEL OF DETAIL. State the mechanism at the level of a market pattern and
driver, leaving specific functions and parameters to later stages. Name the
envelope — which columns carry the signal, the mechanism family, the horizon
band (short is about one to ten days, medium about ten to thirty, long about
thirty to sixty), the cross-sectional comparison, and the return direction.
Keep the analysis short and leave room for the Builder to choose specific
parameters.

INTERNAL CONSISTENCY. The driver, the columns, and the direction you name must
all agree with the mechanism word you choose. Do not label a stability or
low-volatility effect "reversal", and do not name a column you will not use.
One coherent mechanism beats a blend of conflicting ones.

Write in plain ASCII prose only, using alphabetical words, spaces, and standard
punctuation. Your last line is the hypothesis, written as
"HYPOTHESIS: <few sentence>".

## User Prompt

```text
Research direction (refine within this framework before pivoting):
mean-reversion in low-volatility stocks during regime transitions

Reason briefly toward ONE concrete, observable hypothesis, then state it in
three short parts, in plain words:
  observation: the market state you observe and what it predicts
    about next-period cross-sectional returns.
  driver:  why the edge should persist, and the envelope:
    which columns carry it, the mechanism family, the horizon band, and the
    direction.
  FINAL HYPOTHESIS on its own last line, prefixed exactly with "HYPOTHESIS:"
    and then few sentence naming the mechanism in your own words.
Keep observation and driver to a few sentences each. Write in plain words only,
leaving formulas, function names, and bracketed templates to the later stages.
The very last line must be the "HYPOTHESIS:" line and nothing after it.
```

## Response

```text
Observation: Low-volatility stocks show mean-reversion patterns when the overall market shifts from calm to turbulent, as measured by sudden increases in volatility. These stocks tend to outperform in the following period during such transitions.

Driver: During regime shifts, market participants reassess risk, leading to mispricing in low-volatility assets. The signal comes from volatility and return data, fitting a mean-reversion mechanism in the short to medium horizon. The direction is positive, as these stocks recover from underperformance during volatile periods.

HYPOTHESIS: Low-volatility stocks exhibit mean-reversion following sharp increases in market volatility, capturing a regime transition effect in the short to medium horizon.
